# VEX_Spin-Up-66659a

Our team is 66659a, from Lexington High School. This is our code for VEX Robotics Competition HS game, "Spin Up". The objective of this game is to score more points than the opposing alliance by shooting foam disks into a frisbee-like goal, spinning rollers on the edge of the field, and covering as many tiles as possible in the last 10 seconds.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this season we have won:

Match Record: 40 - 16
(x2) Tournament Champions
(x1) SNE Regionals Qualification
(x1) Worlds Qualification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our code can be viewed through the /src folder and the /include folder. Corresponding C++ files have corresponding header files (example.cpp & example.h). Most of the code is documented and has been developed by us with many external public resources such as: George Gillard's PID Document, FRC White Papers, 5225A Pilon's Odometry Document, advice & support from other SNE teams, the PROS Editor/API, and VSCode.
